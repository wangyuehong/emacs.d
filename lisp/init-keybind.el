  "Do-What-I-Mean behaviour for a general `keyboard-quit'.

The DWIM behaviour of this command is as follows:

- When the region is active, disable it.
- When a minibuffer is open, but not focused, close the minibuffer.
- When the Completions buffer is selected, close it.
- When in `vterm-copy-mode', close it.
- When in `vterm-mode', call `vterm-reset-cursor-point'.
- When in `copilot-mode', call function `copilot-chat-goto-input'.
- When in `gptel-mode', call `gptel-end-of-response'.
- When in `comint-mode', call `comint-goto-process-mark'.
- In every other case use the regular `keyboard-quit'."
